    "\n",
    "## üß† What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) is a field of AI where computers learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed.  \n",
    "There are **two main types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supervised Learning** üéØ\n",
    "- **Unsupervised Learning** üîç\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these two, supervised learning is the most widely used in real-world applications and has seen the most rapid innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning algorithms learn to map **inputs (x)** to **outputs (y)**, using example pairs (x, y).  \n",
    "The model is trained on data where the correct outputs are known, so it can later predict the output for new, unseen inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìå Example Tasks:\n",
    "- **Spam Detection**:  \n",
    "  Input: email text ‚Üí Output: spam (1) or not spam (0)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Speech Recognition**:  \n",
    "  Input: audio clip ‚Üí Output: transcript (text)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìà Types of Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### üî¢ Regression\n",
    "- Predicts **continuous numeric values**.\n",
    "- Output: any number (infinite possibilities).\n",
    "- Example: Predicting house prices, temperature, age, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üßÆ Classification\n",
    "- Predicts **discrete categories**.\n",
    "- Output: a class label (e.g., 0 or 1).\n",
    "- Example: Predicting if a tumor is **benign (0)** or **malignant (1)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key difference:\n",
    "> Regression ‚Üí infinite possible outputs  \n",
    "> Classification ‚Üí limited number of classes\n",

    "## üîç Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In **unsupervised learning**, the algorithm is given **data without associated labels (y)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine a dataset with patient information:\n",
    "- Tumor size\n",
    "- Patient age  \n",
    "...but without knowing whether the tumor is **benign** or **malignant**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we're not giving the algorithm the \"correct answer\" ‚Äî there's **no supervision**. Instead, we ask the algorithm to **find patterns or structure in the data** on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìä Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "A common type of unsupervised learning is **clustering**, where the algorithm groups similar data points together based on some similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- The algorithm might discover **two natural clusters** of patients, based on age and tumor size.\n",
    "- These clusters might represent different biological subtypes, even if the algorithm was never told that.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Anomaly Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important unsupervised learning technique is **anomaly detection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It identifies **rare or unusual patterns** in data that don't fit the norm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Used in:\n",
    "- üîê **Fraud detection** (e.g., abnormal credit card transactions)\n",
    "- üö® **Network security** (detecting intrusions)\n",
    "- üß™ **Medical diagnostics** (spotting outliers in patient data)\n",

    "\n",
    "### üîΩ Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction compresses a dataset with **many features** into fewer dimensions while retaining as much **relevant information** as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful for:\n",
    "- Visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D\n",
    "- Reducing noise and overfitting\n",
    "- Speeding up learning algorithms\n",
